# Guess_a_Number
How to Play

Run the Python script guess_number.py.

The first player starts guessing the number.

After each guess:

If the guess is too low, the game will prompt Too Low! and adjust the lower bound.

If the guess is too high, the game will prompt Too High! and adjust the upper bound.

The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

The number of attempts is displayed once the player guesses correctly.

The second player then takes their turn.

The player with the fewest guesses wins.
